<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hey there! My name is Natan Aklilu and I am currently a third-year student 
  at Cornell University studying Computer Science. I am an aspiring 
  software engineer and am currently a TA for one of Cornell's
  core computer science courses, CS 3410: Computer System Organization and Programming. 
  I have gained valuable experience from personal projects, my time on the Cornell 
  project team CU GeoData, and a previous Software Development Engineering Internship
  with Amazon Web Services at their East Palo Alto location. You can find out more 
  by navigating to the <a href="homepage.php?page=projects"> projects</a> page. My passion in
  life is to pursue any areas in which software can make a positive impact on the 
  world and I am specifically interested in Artificial Intelligence but am open 
  to gain any work experience in the field to continue my journey. </p>
